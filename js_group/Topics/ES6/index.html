  <!-- 
    type module - comes in ES6 (ECMAScript2015)
    make restrict to use functions in each other file - restrictive 👲 - so not add those things defined in diff scripts into global context i.e. window obj
    to access only what wanted - export/import <- this are enable to use if type="module"

    you can't modify data of a one script logic from other, you only can call function when import and read data. can't modify even if it declare with `let`. 💀 its like #private declare var which are like only do changes when there given setter function 👲 similer not actually that 
  -->

  <!-- even if intersection.js is not imported but still its get executed, modules check for file imports in each file and create a dependency graph for imported files to track them and their defined code -->
  <script type="module" src="./main.js"></script>
  <script type="module" src="./script.js"></script>
